\section{Application}
The Digital Logic Simulator serves as a versatile tool with applications that are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Students can learn digital logic by building and testing circuits visually. It can make understanding gates and circuits easier.

    \item  Users can create and simulate basic electronic systems quickly.

    \item  The tool generates truth tables for circuits automatically. It saves time for students who are studying logic behavior.

    \item  Users can input boolean expressions and get simpler versions. This can help to optimize circuit designs.

    \item  The tool works on multiple platforms, making it easy to use in classrooms or personal projects.

    \item  Users can model and test logic algorithms (e.g., adders, multiplexers) for correctness and understanding.

    \item  Unlike resource-heavy commercial tools, this project's lightweight SFML-based GUI runs smoothly on older hardware too.

\end{itemize}
