\section{Objectives}

The primary objective of the \textbf{Digital Logic Suite} project is to develop a practical GUI-based tool that helps students in analyzing digital logic circuits, simplifying Boolean expressions and understanding digital logic concepts. The specific objectives are:

\begin{itemize}
      \item To apply object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction to enhance code maintainability and scalability.

      \item To use C++ for implementing the core functionalities of the tool to understand its standard libraries.

      \item To develop and organize custom header files which can help to improve code reusability and modularity throughout the project.

      \item To learn the basics of graphical user interfaces using SFML which can enable clear and interactive visualization of digital circuits.

      \item To design an intuitive and accessible interface that allows users to easily construct, modify, and analyze digital logic circuits.

      \item To make the program run faster and work smoothly in older hardware.

      \item To gain skills to handle larger, more complex projects in the future.

      \item To work together as a team to build and complete the project successfully.

\end{itemize}
