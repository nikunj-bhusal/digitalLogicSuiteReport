\section{Introduction}
Digital logic design is the foundation of modern electronics and computer engineering. It helps to create systems from basic calculators to complex devices. Tools like Logisim and Digital Works let us design and test digital circuits, but they can be hard to use with command lines, and heavy to run.

The Digital Logic Simulator fixes these problems with a user-friendly tool made with SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++. Instead of old command-line tools, this one has a clear graphical interface. We can see logic gates, circuits, and truth tables easily, and it uses object-oriented programming.

The Digital Logic Simulator has an interactive canvas where a user can place logic gates like AND, OR, NOT along with INPUT, and OUTPUT components. It offers real-time simulation, so the user can see how the circuit works based on inputs that we choose. The tool automatically creates truth tables for the circuits designed by a user and it can also simplify the boolean expressions that the user enters

The Digital Logic Simulator is designed with modularity, using core object-oriented programming ideas like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in classes such as Gate, Wire, and Simulator. The SFML graphical interface works on different platforms (tested in Windows and Linux) and renders efficiently.
