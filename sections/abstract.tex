\section*{Abstract}
The Digital Logic Simulator is a user-friendly app built with C++ and SFML (Simple Fast Multimedia Library) to provide features like designing, testing, and studying digital logic circuits. It uses object-oriented programming ideas to make a helpful tool for students.

\vspace{0.5cm}
Users can place logic gates like AND, OR, NOT, INPUT, and OUTPUT, then connect them with wires to build circuits. This application can be used to see how circuits work in real time and makes truth tables for the designs. Users can also enter Boolean expressions and see their simplified form on the screen.

This tool is a lighter option compared to expensive software, works well on different systems, and includes key features for learning digital logic. The project shows how to use C++ programming effectively and sets the stage for future improvements in circuit simulation.
