\section{Results}

With the completion of the project, the objectives of the Digital Logic Simulator were successfully achieved, and the simulator was developed. The project was implemented with the necessary features, including placing logic gates, connecting components, real-time simulation, truth table generation, Boolean expression simplification, and a user-friendly graphical interface.

During the testing phase, various sample circuits were constructed to evaluate the simulator's accuracy and performance. The simulator correctly computed outputs for all tested logic combinations, and the graphical interface responded to the user interactions. Performance remained stable even with complex circuits. This confirmed that the project could be run on older hardware without significant issues which further confirmed that the objectives were achieved.

The project also provided valuable learning outcomes. We gained hands-on experience in object-oriented programming, real-time simulation design, and graphics rendering with SFML. Additionally, collaboration and problem-solving skills were enhanced, learning to work in cooperation with a team and collectively create solutions to problems as a team.
